            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in philosophy at Columbia University and expect to defend my dissertation this year. Born and raised in western New York, I have lived in New York City for the last 7.5 years and currently reside in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Outside of researching and teaching philosophy, I enjoy exploring this extraordinary city, listening to music, watching movies, reading about aviation, and spending time with my two cats.</p>
        
            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>My teaching experience has made it evident that students learn differently, and so I adjust my methods to fit clients’ needs.
                In particular, I emphasize finding a balance in two respects. The first is between providing and withholding answers:
                this ensures that students get the help they need, but also are on the path to mastering the material for themselves.
                The second is between offering criticism and support: students will never grow without constructive criticism, but they
                also need encouragement to build their confidence.</p>

            <h2>Why Work with Me?</h2>
            <h3>Capable</h3>
            <p>I scored 800 on the SAT Verbal and Writing sections and 720 (98th percentile) on the GRE Verbal. I also received 800 on the
                SAT subject tests in US History and World History and 5 on eight AP exams. I attained a 3.84 undergraduate GPA and a
                3.88 graduate GPA.</p>
            
            <h3>Experienced</h3>
            <p>I have served as a teaching assistant for eleven courses and as primary instructor for two, one of which was a course for
                high school students. I have also worked with students with minimal backgrounds in secondary and higher education by
                serving in the Columbia philosophy department’s outreach program, Rethink.</p>
            
            <h3>Affordable</h3>
            <p>Access to high-quality tutoring shouldn’t depend on the size of your wallet. I have a similar background to tutors at elite
                tutoring and test-prep agencies. Moreover, I offer services of comparable quality, but at a much lower rate, since I
                am an independent contractor.</p>
            
            <h3>Flexible</h3>
            <p>I am available seven days a week to meet in any of the five boroughs. While I prefer to work with clients in-person at their
                residence or a location convenient for them, I also do sessions online. </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Alex was a very good TA. Probably the best I’ve had at Columbia thus far. He is knowledgeable and approachable. He always made time during office hours and gave helpful feedback on essays.</p>
                <cite>student evaluation, Justice, spring 2016</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I think Alex is one of the best TA’s I’ve had at Columbia and I’m sure he’s going to make a great professor one day. He is extremely approachable and nice which makes engaging with the subject so much more enjoyable.</p>
                <cite>student evaluation, Justice, spring 2016</cite>

            <blockquote>
                <p>This is probably the best TA I have had at my time here at Columbia. Not only can you tell that he is very knowledgeable on the subject material but you can tell he is genuinely interested in it. Furthermore, he is genuinely interested in helping you, as a student, produce effective work. This was not even my TA and I went to his office hours to discuss the final paper and he was extremely helpful, took into consideration past comments from my TA, stayed late to help me even though I was late for our meeting time and offered to continue to correspond with me as I was getting my paper together. Seriously, a phenomenal, kind, and hard-working TA.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Alex was one of my favorite TA’s of all time. He cares deeply about his students. What stood out to me about Alex was, first, the sense of gratitude he has around meeting to discuss philosophy. He really made recitation feel like a special place to be by thanking students at the beginning of every recitation for being there. Alex also commands a deep understanding of the material, and discussions in recitation were always informative. Alex was an excellent facilitator of discussion, and additionally answered questions clearly and in an informative way. Finally, Alex was extremely understanding, and I really appreciated how kind he was as a TA. I enjoyed recitation, and thanks for a great semester.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Alex is one of the most understanding, best TA’s I’ve had while studying philosophy here. He will go out of his way (despite being very busy!) to meet with and help students, and he has shown me kindness and understanding without being patronizing at all. His knowledge of philosophy is both deep and broad, and he has no problem admitting that there are things he does not know or is unsure about. He treats people with respect, is enthusiastic, and very well-organized. I didn’t attend very many recitation sections either (I was writing a thesis that took over my life), but Alex has been able to meet with me and give me the attention required for me to be able to take away a lot from the course. He’s outshone nearly every other TA I’ve had here, and would no doubt make an excellent teacher or professor one day.</p>

                <p>Alex is an amazing TA. He is very enthusiastic and always seeks to answer my questions on a timely basis. I would love to have him as my TA in any class</p>
                <cite>student evaluation, Freedom of Speech &amp; the Press, fall 2016</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Alex is amazing. He radiates with passion. It was absurd how much he knows given that he’s a grad student. It was insane how much he very clearly prepared for every lecture and topic. I’m not a philosophy major nor have I taken a lot of philosophy courses, but it was an absolute joy to have him as my instructor. I feel like he’s going to make an INCREDIBLE professor one day and has a super-bright future ahead. Easily one of my favorite professors at Columbia</p>
